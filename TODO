TODO

Crypto.EllipticCurve.Curve
--------------------------
* Add support for curves/points with different fundamental operations than
  double and add.
* Have `montgomery` use the more efficient `double` method rather than adding
  a point to itself in order to double. (Crypto.Number.Power)

Crypto.EllipticCurve.Field
--------------------------
* Add support for doubling/squaring methods in case these are more efficient
  in the underlying field.
