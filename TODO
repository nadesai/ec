TODO

Crypto.EllipticCurve.Curve
--------------------------
* Edwards curves.
* Add support for curves/points with different fundamental operations than
  double and add.

Crypto.Number.Power
-------------------
* Have `montgomery` use the more efficient `double` method rather than adding
  a point to itself in order to double. (Crypto.Number.Power)

Crypto.EllipticCurve.Field
--------------------------
* Add support for doubling/squaring methods in case these are more efficient
  in the underlying field.

Crypto.EllipticCurve.OpenSSL.P521
---------------------------------
* Make addition/subtraction/negation/etc not overflow in C.

Misc
----
* Add a wrapper for ECDH that returns the X-coordinate of multiplication.
